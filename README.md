ITI 201 	Homework Assignment #6	Due: Mon. 11/14 by noon

Java Exercises


INSTRUCTIONS:

PLEASE FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY.

1)	In Eclipse, create a project called

“Homework6_<YOUR LASTNAME>” (for example, Homework6_Smith).

2)	For each problem you do, create a new class called “HW6_<EXERCISE NUMBER>” (for example, HW6_4 for exercise #4).
The new classes (as .java files) will automatically go in the folder Homework6_Smith/src When you create your classes, the first two lines should look like this:
public class HW6_x {

public static void main(String[] args) {

You can run your classes independently this way and test/debug your work.

3)	When done, save your project, compress the entire source code folder (src) from your drive (i.e. zip it), and name your compressed file: Homework6_<YOUR LAST NAME>.zip. JUST COMPRESS YOUR src DIRECTORY, NOT THE bin ONE AS WELL!

Your zipped file should contain the following:

Homework6_Smith.zip

→	src  (directory)

→	HW6_1.java  (file)

→	HW6_2.java  (file)

→	… etc …

→	HW6_8.java  (file)

→	HW6_9.java  (file)

4)	Upload the zipped file to Sakai, under the Assignments tab.

Note:


A lot of this homework is based on homework #5. Feel free to reference your previous work.

EXERCISES:

1.	Write this code, shown here as pseudocode, in Java. Make sure you have no errors of

syntax or logic. Save and run it to make sure.	(5 pts.)
		
myName = “Sue Smith”	// Use your real full name here	
print “Hello! My name is ”, myName, “. Nice to meet you!”	
print (3 empty lines)		
print “Go Scarlet Knights!”		
		


2.	Write this (hopefully familiar) code, shown here as pseudocode, in Java. Make sure you

have no errors of syntax or logic. Save and run it to make sure.	(10 pts.)
			
a = 0			
while ( a <= 12 )			
print a, “---”, a*a			
a = a + 1	// end of while loop		
print “All done!”			
			


3.	Write this code, shown here as pseudocode, in Java. Make sure you have no errors of syntax or logic. Save and run it to make sure. Do this twice:
	(10 pts.)
			
set a = 8,  set c = 1			
while ( c < 15 )			
if (a <= 10) then a = a + 2		
else a = a – 10			
print a			
c = c + 1	// end of while loop		
			


4.	Write code in Java to do the following task. Make sure you have no errors of syntax or logic. Save and run it to make sure. (15 pts.)

Task: add two numbers “x” and “y”. If their sum is 3 then make another number “z” equal to that sum, otherwise “z” is zero. Do this for two instances: once when “x” is 1 and “y” is 2, and another when both “x” and “y” are 2.

5.	Write this code, shown here as pseudocode, in Java.	(15 pts.)

n = 10 
while (n >1)

print n

if ( n is even ) then n = n/2

else
n = 3*n + 1
//	end of while loop



6.	Write out Java code that generates the following number sequence using a while loop: 

1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233	(15 pts.)


7.	Write Java code that generates this exact print out using two while loops:

 (15 pts.)

8.	Copy and paste this code exactly as it is in Eclipse.

This code contains 10 errors – find them and fix them all. Some are syntactical; some are grammatical, while others are logical. Save and run the code to make sure (what do you

expect the correct code to do? That should help you figure this out!)	(15 pts.)

Int beerNum	= 99;
String word	= "bottles";
while (beerNum > 0) {
if (beerNum = 1)  {
/ When	it’s just one, it’s bottle, not bottles
word =	"bottle"
}	
System.out.println(beerNum + " " + word + " of beer on the wall"); System.out.println(beerNum + " " + word + " of beer"); System.put.println(Take one down.);
System.out.println("Pass it around."); beerNum = beerNum + 1;

if (beerNum.isgreaterthan(0))	{

System.out.println(beerNum + " " + word + " of beer on the wall");
}

while

{
System.out.println("No more bottles of beer on the wall");

}

}
}



EXTRA CREDIT:


9.	Write a loop that prints numbers 1 to 50 but replaces multiples of 4 with the word ‘Java’ and multiples of 6 with ‘Bean’ and multiples of both with ‘JavaBean’. (10 pts.)
